      Vanjangi village is located in the Visakhapatnam district of Andhra Pradesh, India, in the Paderu Tehsil. It is 8 kilometres from the sub-district headquarters in Paderu and 125 kilometres from the district headquarters in Visakhapatnam. With the incredible sights on offer, Vanjangi, which is 3400 feet above sea level, has become a tourist hotspot. Scenes of dense clouds floating endlessly amid the hills form a sight to behold as you approach the vantage point at the location early in the morning. The most auspicious time to visit Vanjangi is at sunrise, when an orange twilight proudly announces the arrival of the sun beyond the cloud cover. Many visitors are choosing to camp in the open spaces because the village does not yet have any tourist accommodation facilities.Megha Samudram, or the Ocean of Clouds, is the name given to this newly discovered hill heaven. And the name seems fitting, given that tourists have never seen such an assemblage of clouds at such high altitudes, every beautiful morning. A sight not to be missed is the golden light tinting the cloud cover as it floats endlessly.The dawn unfolds gradually, and a golden horizon pops into view as the sun rises from the midst of dense, wispy clouds. The morning is cool and crisp, and every sense is heightened as one witnesses the dreamlike cascade of clouds billow like a river. The sun rises over the cleaving of two hills and soon you find yourself standing above a veritable abode of clouds, which float like sea waves would, under the influence. Soon, the mountain tops reveal themselves, leaving you to behold the canvas of a beautiful morning.
